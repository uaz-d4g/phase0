## Question Pool

---

**Path:** TBD

**Type:** PA

**Stem:** Which three sources can be used to generate questions and answers for a knowledge base? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

**Answer Choices:**

- [x] a webpage
- [ ] an audio file
- [x] an existing FAQ document
- [ ] an image file
- [x] manually entered data

**Explanation:** A webpage or an existing document, such as a text file containing question and answer pairs, can be used to generate a knowledge base. You can also manually enter the knowledge base question-and-answer pairs. You cannot directly use an image or an audio file to import a knowledge base.

**Path:** TBD

**Type:** PA

**Stem:** At which layer can you apply content filters to suppress prompts and responses for a responsible generative AI solution?

**Answer Choices:**

- [ ] Metaprompt and grounding
- [ ] Model
- [x] Safety system
- [ ] User experience

**Explanation:** The safety system layer includes platform-level configurations and capabilities that help mitigate harm. For example, the Azure OpenAI service includes support for content filters that apply criteria to suppress prompts and responses based on the classification of content into four severity levels (safe, low, medium, and high) for four categories of potential harm (hate, sexual, violence, and self-harm).

**Path:** TBD

**Type:** PA

**Stem:** [Answer choice] can return responses, such as natural language, images, or code, based on natural language input.

**Answer Choices:**

- [ ] Computer vision
- [ ] Deep learning
- [x] Generative AI
- [ ] Machine learning
- [ ] Reinforcement learning

**Explanation:** Generative AI models offer the capability of generating images based on a prompt by using DALL-E models, such as generating images from natural language. The other AI capabilities are used in different contexts to achieve other goals.

**Path:** TBD

**Type:** PA

**Stem:** Select the answer that correctly completes the sentence. [Answer choice] can be used to identify constraints and styles for the responses of a generative AI model.

**Answer Choices:**

- [ ] Data grounding
- [ ] Embeddings
- [x] System messages
- [ ] Tokenization

**Explanation:** System messages should be used to set the context for the model by describing expectations. Based on system messages, the model knows how to respond to prompts. The other techniques are also used in generative AI models, but for other use cases.

**Stem:** Which two capabilities are examples of a GPT model? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

**Answer Choices:**

- [x] Create natural language
- [ ] Detect specific dialects of a language
- [ ] Generate closed captions in real-time from a video
- [ ] Synthesize speech
- [x] Understand natural language

**Explanation:** Azure OpenAI natural language models can take in natural language and generate responses. GPT models are excellent at both understanding and creating natural language.

**Stem:** You train a regression model by using automated machine learning (automated ML) in the Azure Machine Learning studio. You review the best model summary. You need to publish the model for others to use from the internet. What should you do next?

**Answer Choices:**

- [ ] Create a compute cluster.
- [x] Deploy the model to an endpoint.
- [ ] Split the data into training and validation datasets.
- [ ] Test the deployed service.

**Explanation:** You can deploy the best performing model for client applications to use over the internet by using an endpoint. Compute clusters are used to train the model and are created directly after you create a Machine Learning workspace. Before you can test the model’s endpoint, you must deploy it first to an endpoint. Automated ML performs the validation automatically, so you do not need to split the dataset.
